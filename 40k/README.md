# 40K Rules Reference card

Warhammer 40K 10th edition Core Rules Reference as a editable and printable web page. The page is intended to be printed as an A4 size PDF without margins.

This is the first version of the styles. All content is copied from the [awesome PDF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/140kf10/10th_ed_core_rules_reference_one_doublesided_page/) by Reddit user's [Bubbly_Corgi317](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bubbly_Corgi317/), but I wanted a retro layout for myself along the lines of the original 1993 2nd edition rule reference cards.

There are a lot of errors, and they are due to fast copying. This is not yet worth using in games, but I'm happy to take suggestions for corrections or pull requests.
